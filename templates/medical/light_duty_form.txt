[hr]1. [b][u]Definition.[/u][/b] A member is in light duty status when it is necessary to evaluate the effect that an illness, injury, or disease process has on a service memberâ€™s ability to be in a medically unrestricted duty status.
[hr]2. [b][u]Maximum Time in Status.[/u][/b] A physician may recommend up to 3 periods of 30 days of light duty when the member is expected to be returned to full duty within those 90 days.
Some conditions may require referral to the local Military Treatment Facility (MTF) for dictation of a Medical Evaluation Board (MEB), if warranted.[/table]
